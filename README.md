###Preface

This is a set of laboratory assignments designed to complement the introductory robotics lectures taught at the University of Texas at Dallas. Together, the lectures and labs introduce students to robot manipulators and computer vision and serve as the foundation for more advanced courses on robot dynamics and control and computer vision.  

For success in the laboratory, each student should have completed a course in linear algebra and be comfortable with three-dimensional geometry. In addition, it is imperative that all students have completed a course in computer programming, preferably in C or C++.  Spong, Hutchinson, and Vidyasagar’s textbook Robot Modeling and Control (John Wiley and Sons:  New York, 2006) is required for the lectures and will be used as a reference for many of the lab assignments. We will hereafter refer to the textbook as SH&V in this lab manual.

Enjoy the course!
